# Sandbox-Progression
This repository contains small exercises in Python and is intended to showcase my practice and progression developing quantitative techniques through python.
This repo will also serve as a place where I can view my progression overtime. I am still in the beginning stages of learning Python as well as other languages and techniques, and beleive it will be helpful to look back on and track my development, even in the early stages.
